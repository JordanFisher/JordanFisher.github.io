TL;DR

AI changes what we need from governance
Societies that allow for freedom and maximum human flourishing aren’t easy to build

Ours took thousands of years of trial and error and is still a work in progress

What allows a society to function depends strongly on the details of its members: us humans

Introducing AI will completely change all of those details

Because of that, we must rethink society if we want it to be resilient to the arrival of AI

There are many risks we’ll face, and some risks aren’t yet being discussed
In particular, the risk of concentration of power and dictatorship is extreme with the full power of AI automation

Without changes, dictatorships are a default outcome of AI. And it will be increasingly hard for us to resist it the later we act

We must evolve our governance before strong AI arrives, or we may not have any power left as citizens to fix it after

Humans alone won’t be able to oversee leaders empowered by AI

AI-powered governance of AI
Instead, we must leverage AI itself to become part of the checks and balances on how government and industry wield AI

Passing laws is necessary but not sufficient

We must enshrine the oversight inside the mechanisms of culture and government, and we must do it while we still have human-based trust in human institutions

We all are part of this
AI is the most important event in our life time, but the outcome is not yet written

We all own the conversation for what we want the future to be
