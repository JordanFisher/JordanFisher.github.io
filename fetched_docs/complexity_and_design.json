The success of computational fluid dynamics vindicates this approach, along with the safety of aircraft and multitudes of other technologies predicated on our correct-enough understanding of fluids like air. Even in these simplified theories, we see complexity continue to counter us. Fluids become turbulent and enter chaotic regimes where it\u2019s not just our current models that lose predictive powers, rather all models must lose their power. The price for these failures of theory can be death \u2014 a price we've paid with thousands of plane crashes as we've evolved our understanding of the complexities of fluids.\n",
