The debate for how to govern a human-machine society may prove the greatest in our lifetime, perhaps as important as the founding debates around modern democracies themselves. Every one of us has a role to play: to engage in this debate, to shape it, to fight for governance that lifts up humanity and ensures this new age that’s upon us will be a noble one, not a dark one.

In this tiny book we’ll cover the basics:


Machines have now reached human intelligence in many domains, and will soon surpass us in most others
If we understand why this progress is accelerating, we will be able to better design how we want to integrate it into human society


Societies that allow for freedom and maximum human flourishing aren’t easy to build
Ours took thousands of years of trial and error and is still a work in progress
What allows a society to function depends strongly on the details of its members: us humans


Automating our economy and government will completely change all of those details
As those details change, all of the implicit guardrails we rely upon for checks and balances will be swept away
Because of that, we must rethink society if we want it to be resilient to the arrival of AI
In particular, the risk of concentration of power and dictatorship is extreme with the full power of AI automation


Automation will increasingly consolidate power into fewer and fewer hands, and the guardrails preventing abuse of that power will continue to become obsolete
Gradually, and then all at once, we will enter a world where checks on power are impotent
If we don’t change course, tyranny is the default outcome of AI. And it will be increasingly hard for us to resist it the later we act
We must evolve our governance before strong AI arrives, or we may not have any power left as citizens to fix it after
Humans alone won’t be able to oversee leaders empowered by AI. As is stands, whoever controls AI will control nearly everything


The forces and incentives are already at play to further concentrate power
We can’t predict how all those forces will play out, but we can think through different scenarios
Here we’ll explore a short story walking down our current path, and how it leads to an unrecoverable concentration of power and the end of liberty
The future will almost surely play out differently, in one of a million possible paths. We need to set the conditions so that the future is bright regardless of the path


So what should we do? What should those conditions be?
How can we upgrade our society and governance to be resilient to the multitude of forces pushing us toward tyranny?
We must leverage AI itself to become part of the checks and balances on how government and industry wield AI
Passing laws is necessary but not sufficient. An executive branch powered by superintelligence will be too strong to control if we only upgrade our laws but don’t also upgrade our oversight and enforcement
We must enshrine the enforcement of laws inside the mechanisms of culture and government, and we must do it while we still have human-based trust in human institutions


We should think through and imagine how things may go wrong, to better design a more resilient system
But we should also imagine how things might go right, to ensure we’re building a future we want to live in
Here we’ll illustrate a positive, near future by telling a short story of how things might go well, assuming we upgrade our checks and balances
A positive future will surely play out differently than we expect, even if things go well. But we must set a vision of what good looks like so we know what we’re fighting for


The discussion around AI policy has rapidly become politically coded
Adopting all the policies of the left, or all of the policies of the right, will likely lead to disaster
If we only regulate and slow down AI, we will cede the race to China
If we only automate our government and military, we will hand so much power over to our government that we may never be free again
Instead, we must modernize our government and military to remain the dominant superpower, and we must simultaneously upgrade the oversight and safeguards that prevent abuse of this incredible concentration of power


Intelligence is the most transformative power the world has ever seen. Until today, that power has been human alone. Now, with AI, we are on the precipice of unleashing that power a thousand fold, and it won’t be human
The force of multiplied intelligence completely rewrites the rules of our world. With it we may see near infinite abundance, or total ruin
We are on the exponential now. Where will it take us? We must decide
AI is the defining event of our lifetime, but the outcome is not yet written. We all own the conversation for what we want the future to be
If we don’t together lead this debate —all of us— then the most important decisions of the future of our world will be made without us

For those looking for a primer on AI, we recommend starting with . For everyone else, I’ll see you on the curve.
